Plants include familiar types such as trees, herbs, bushes, grasses, vines, ferns, mosses, and green algae.
Most plants grow in the ground, with stems in the air and roots below the surface. Some float on water. The root part absorbs water and some nutrients the plant needs to live and grow. These climb the stem and reach the leaves. The evaporation of water from pores in the leaves pulls water through the plant. This is called transpiration.
A plant needs sunlight, carbon dioxide, minerals and water to make food through photosynthesis.
The word plant can also mean the action of putting something in the ground. For example, farmers plant seeds in the field.
Plants eventually bear flowers and fruits which are consumed by most insects and humans.
