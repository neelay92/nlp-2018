Industrial plants are factories or buildings where goods are manufactured.
It refers to necessary infrastructure used in operation and maintenance of a given facility. The operation of these facilities, or the department of an organisation which does so, is called "plant operations" or facility management.
A factory or manufacturing plant is an industrial site, usually consisting of buildings and machinery, or more commonly a complex having several buildings, where workers manufacture goods or operate machines processing one product into another.
Chemical plants use specialised equipment, units, and technology in the manufacturing process.
These plants have high manpower and significant power consumption. They also seem to be contributors to pollution. 
The car installation plant was successful as it provided jobs too many. A manufacturing plant generally requires a large piece of land. 
Setting up a plant also requires lot of money and effort.
